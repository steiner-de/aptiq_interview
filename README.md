This repo will address the following exercise with step by step instructions. 

# Problem Statement
Please generate a python project that will conduct webscraping to collect information from the
humor category of https://books.toscrape.com/
We recommend using a recent version of python as well as a parsing library such as beautiful
soup.

Additionally capture the following:
  1. Scrape all books in the Humor category:
      - Follow pagination if there are multiple pages.
      - For each book, collect:
      - UPC (from the product page)
      - Title
      - Price
      - Image URL
  2. Output the collected data as a list of objects in a JSON file, with one entry per book.
      - The output will be stored in a provided directory
  4. Document all steps so another developer can:
      - Install required libraries (e.g., beautifulsoup4, requests).
      - Run the script to reproduce the same results.

# Instructions on how to execute package
